Reading tags before first section


Sometimes, you need to have tags before the first section of an INI file. Also,
some INI files are headerless, i.e. contain only tags and no headers. However,
MiniINI requires you to read variables from a section.

To support such files, INIFile contains a section called __[DEFAULT]__ that 
contains tags before the first (if any) section. You can access it like any 
other section using the //GetSection// method.

**Note**: This section is called __[DEFAULT]__, including brackets, to prevent 
conflicts with loaded section names as they can't contain brackets.

Example:
```
ini.GetSection("[DEFAULT]");
```
