There are two ways to read arrays with MiniINI. The first is to read from tags 
with multiple values. The other is to read from series of numbered tags.

Reading from multi value tags is both faster (parsing wise), and such tags take
less space. Series of tags might be more practical in some cases, though. Both
ways are explained here.

== ReadMultiXXX ==

MiniINI parses commas as value separators, so a value with commas will be parsed
as an array. This also means a single value **can't** contain commas. You can 
read from multi value tags using //INISection// methods 
//[ReadMultiString _0]//, //[ReadMultiInt _1]//, //[ReadMultiFloat _2]// and 
//[ReadMultiBool _3]//. These methods have versions to read to plain C arrays 
and STL vectors. Like the //ReadXXX// methods, they work similarly to each 
other.

Non-STL versions take tag name, buffer to read to and buffer capacity, i.e. 
**how many values** of read type the buffer can hold. They return number of 
values read (zero if the tag doesn't exist). Tag name **must** be a zero 
terminated string and the buffer must have at least specified capacity. 
//ReadMultiXXX// will read **at most** as many values as specified capacity, 
even if there are more in the file. //ReadMultiString//, like //ReadString//, 
only writes pointers (C strings) to the buffer, so you have to copy the data if
you want to use it after the //INIFile// is deleted.

STL versions are a bit simpler: Like STL //ReadXXX//, tag name is a C++ string, 
and the buffer is a vector. There is no need to pass capacity as vector can 
enlarge as needed. Like the non-STL version, number of read values is returned.

**Note:** if a value has incorrect type (e.g. __"abc"__ can't be parsed as int 
when using //ReadInt//), only values before it are read.

Example:

If we have a file containing a multi value tag like this:
```
;section header, other tags
;...
images=01.png,02.png,03.png
;...
;other ini data
```

We can read to array like this:

Non-STL version:
```
//load a file, get section...
unsigned cap = 16;
const char** buf = new const char* [cap];
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadMultiString("images", buf, cap);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find multi value tag images=";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization - don't forget to delete buf !
```

STL version:
```
//don't forget to include <vector>
//load a file, get section...
vector<std::string> buf;
std::string name = "images";
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadMultiString(name, buf);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find multi value tag images=";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization
```

== MultiValSize ==

In above examples using non-STL methods, we allocate a fixed space of memory 
without knowing size needed to store all values. //INISection// method 
//[MultiValSize _4]// can determine this size. It takes a tag name, and returns 
number of values in that tag (zero if the tag doesn't exist). Again, the tag 
name **must** be a zero terminated string.

Non-STL example with MultiValSize:
```
//load a file, get section...
unsigned cap = section->MultiValSize("images");
const char** buf = new const char* [cap];
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadMultiString("images", buf, cap);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find multi value tag images=";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization - don't forget to delete buf !
```

Now you should know all you need to load arrays from multi value tags. If you
don't want to learn about how to read arrays from series of numbered tags, you
can skip the rest of the tutorial.

== ReadXXXs ==

MiniINI can also read arrays from series of numbered tags, such as:
```
img1=01.png
img2=02.png
img3=03.png
...
img10=10.png
```

Indices in INI files start at 1, not 0 like C/C++ arrays. Reading arrays this
way is almost the same as multi value tags, but instead of //ReadMultiXXX// and 
//MultiValSize// you use //[ReadStrings _5]//, //[ReadInts _6]//, 
//[ReadFloats _7]//, //[ReadBools _8]// and //[ArraySize _9]//. The first 
argument of //ReadXXXs// is a base name of tags in the sequence, i.e. __"img"__ 
in the above example. Other arguments are identical.

If you want just plain numbers without a base name, you can use empty string 
(__""__), to read from a sequence like this:
```
1=01.png
2=02.png
3=03.png
```

If an index is missing (e.g. you have __img1__ and __img3__, but not __img2__), 
only values before that index are read. Same thing happens if a value can't be
parsed as the expected type.

Example:

If a file contains this:
```
;section header, other tags
;...
img1=01.png
img2=02.png
img3=03.png
;...
;other data
```

We can read it using //ReadXXXs// like this:

Non-STL version:
```
//load a file, get section...
unsigned cap = 16;
const char** buf = new const char* [cap];
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadStrings("img", buf, cap);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find multi value tag images=";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization - don't forget to delete buf !
```

STL version:
```
//don't forget to include <vector>
//load a file, get section...
vector<std::string> buf;
std::string name = "img";
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadStrings(name, buf);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find multi value tag images=";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization
```

//ArraySize// is similar to //MultiValSize//, but it determines number of tags 
with given base name.

Non-STL version using //ArraySize// to determine space to allocate:
```
//load a file, get section...
//...
unsigned cap = section->ArraySize("img");
const char** buf = new const char* [cap];
unsigned imgcount = section->ReadStrings("img", buf, cap);
if(!imgcount)
    std::cout << "ERROR: Could not find tag array img";
for(unsigned image = 0; image < imgcount; ++image)
    std::cout << buf[image] << std::endl;
//more code and deinitialization - don't forget to delete buf !
```
