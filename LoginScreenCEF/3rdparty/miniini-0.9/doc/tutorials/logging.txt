Logging MiniINI warnings

It can be useful for users of your program to see errors in their INI files.
MiniINI provides warnings about incorrect or suspicious INI file data. It will
will also emit assertion errors with detailed information if you pass incorrect 
input to its methods. You can take advantage of this by enabling MiniINI 
logging.

== Enabling MiniINI logging ==

Logging works **only** with the debug build (**libminiini-dbg**). It also 
requires you to provide a callback function for MiniINI to call when it has 
something to log.

=== Providing logging callback ===

First, you have to write the function. It must take a const pointer to const 
char (C string) and return nothing. MiniINI logging messages don't end with 
a newline, so in order to write each message to a new line you have to write 
it yourself.

Example logging callback function:   
```
void Log(const char * const log)
{
    std::cout << log << std::endl;
}
```

To make MiniINI use this function for logging, you have to pass it with the 
//[INILogCallback _0]// function. You should do this before you load any files,
otherwise logging won't be used for those files.
```
INILogCallback(Log);
```

You can also change the logging function more than once if you want. That's all 
for this tutorial.
