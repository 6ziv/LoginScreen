MiniINI can only have single comment character, but not all INI files use
semicolon (__';'__) for comments. For instance, the __'#'__ character is 
commonly used for this purpose. Fortunately, it's possible to set the character 
to specify comments.

To do this, we use the //[INISetComment _0]// function. It takes one argument: 
the comment character. //INISetComment// returns __true__ if the comment 
character was set successfully, __false__ otherwise. (Other characters that have 
special meanings in an ini file, such as __'['__ or __'\n'__ can't be used to 
specify comments.)

You can also change the name/value separator character (__'='__ by default),
using the //[INISetSeparator _1]// function. This function works just like 
//INISetComment//: it takes a character to use as the separator, returns 
__true__ if it was set successfully, __false__ otherwise.

**NOTE:** //INISetComment// and //INISetSeparator// will only affect files 
opened **after** they were called!

Example:
```
INISetComment('#');
INISetSeparator(':');
```

This will make MiniINI parse anything between __'#'__ and end of line as a 
comment (i.e. ignore it) and separate tag names and values by the __':'__ 
character.
