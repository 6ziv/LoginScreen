<H1>Internal storage of INI data in MiniINI</H1>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="body" ID="body">
<P>
This article explains how INI sections and tags are stored by MiniINI and 
compares it to other possible implementations of INI data storage. Reading this
article isn't necessary to use MiniINI, but it should explain its workings to
those who wish to understand and/or modify it.
</P>
<H2>INIFile</H2>
<P>
<I>INIFile</I> provides access to INI data and ensures that the user can't 
manipulate it directly to prevent errors. <I>INIFile</I> handles creation and
deletion of INISections and any resulting errors so even larger changes to 
implementation won't break the interface. <I>INIFile</I> is a simple container, 
storing <I>INISections</I> in an array of pointers.
</P>
<H2>INISection</H2>
<H3>Basic INISection implementation idea</H3>
<P>
To implement INI data storage, one could use something like this:
</P>
<PRE>
class INISection
{
    private:
        std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; TagValues;
};
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
This is very simple to code and might be good enough in most cases. However, 
there's actually quite large overhead here.
</P>
<P>
Let's look at memory usage. Each tag is stored as two std::strings. On a 64bit 
machine, <I>std::string</I> usually contains at least the following data members: 
</P>
<PRE>
32bit unsigned UsedBytes;
32bit unsigned AllocatedBytes;
64bit pointer  String;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
We also have to count the trailing zero, which adds one more byte. As each tag
uses <B>two</B> C++ strings, this adds up to 34 bytes for every single tag in the 
file. Also, as the string data is in dynamically allocated buffers, we have to
count with some bookkeeping bytes to increase this even further. Now, your 
typical INI tag, such as:
</P>
<PRE>
tagname=value
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
might have about 10-20 bytes of useful data on average. This means that the size 
of stored data is usually more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
If you want to support tags with multiple values, such as:
</P>
<PRE>
tagname=val1,val2,val3
</PRE>
<P>
this can get even worse, as you'd have to use something like:
</P>
<PRE>
std::map&lt;std::string, std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&gt; TagValues;
</PRE>
<P>
In this case, even for tags with just one value, you can expect 16 more bytes
which is usually the size of <I>std::vector</I>. So 50+ bytes per, 10-20 bytes 
of useful data. Also, the data can be spread all over the memory, which won't be
good for cache performance.
</P>
<P>
Allocating all these little blocks of memory takes a lot of time, and STL 
classes do a lot of copying and reallocation when used, which slows down parsing
and accessing the data significantly.
</P>
<P>
Of course, this won't affect you if you're using 20kiB INI files on a modern PC, 
but could cause a performance hit if you're coding for a platform with limited 
resources or storing large amount of data in INI files.
</P>
<H3>A more effective way</H3>
<P>
The first thing that comes to mind is to minimize usage of STL classes. For
instance, replacing std::strings by C strings should save some memory. 
<I>INISection</I> could be reimplemented as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
class INISection
{
    struct TagValue
    {
        unsigned Size;
        char ** TagAndValues;
    };
    private:
        std::vector&lt;TagValue&gt; TagValues;
};
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
where <I>TagAndValues</I> is a buffer of C strings, first of which is the tag name,
and others are values (multi value tags are supported here). Size is number of 
strings in <I>TagAndValues</I>.
</P>
<P>
Memory overhead per tag is at least 4 + 8 + Size * (8 + 1) bytes, or 30+ bytes 
per tag. This is better than 50+ bytes in the previous case, but we can still 
expect INI data size to double. As now handle memory manually, we can cut down 
STL's reallocation and copying, at the cost of considerably uglier code.
</P>
<P>
We still haven't solved the greatest problem of previous implementation, which 
is the fact that INI data is spread over many small buffers, each of which 
requires an 8-byte pointer and 1-byte trailing zero character, plus unknown
number of bookkeeping bytes for dynamically allocated memory.  Still, cache
performance should be a bit better thanks to smaller data size.
</P>
<H3>How MiniINI does this</H3>
<P>
If you measure memory usage of MiniINI (using tools such as Massif), you might 
notice that it usually uses only a bit more memory than the size of files it 
loads. So how does MiniINI get rid of all that overhead?
</P>
<P>
If you look at <I>INISection</I> implementation in MiniINI, it might not be very 
descriptive. Even though it supports multi value tags, you'd see something
like this:
</P>
<PRE>
class INISection
{
    private:
        unsigned Length;
        char ** Tags;
};
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
There is apparently just a single dynamically allocated array of strings. So 
where did the vector of arrays of strings go?
</P>
<P>
The answer lies in how MiniINI stores tags. Each tag with all its values is 
stored in a single buffer. Normally, we expect to store just one string in a 
buffer. However, thanks to the fact that C/C++ uses a zero as the end of the 
string, we can actually have multiple strings in a single buffer. Each tag in
MiniINI consists of tag name, ended by a trailing zero, followed by any number 
of tag values, each followed by a zero, and the last value is followed by two 
zeroes. So a tag like:
</P>
<PRE>
tag=val1,val2,val3
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
would be stored like this:
</P>
<PRE>
"tag\0val1\0val2\0val3\0\0"
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
This removes the ability to directly access each value, which would seemingly
slow down the implementation. This is not necessarily the case, however. If 
we're reading a single value tag, the cost of skipping the tag name string is
insignificant compared to the time it took to search for the requested tag. 
We also save the time that would be spent on allocation of extra buffers in the
previous case. When reading multiple values from a single tag, we must skip one 
string per every value, instead of allocating one buffer for every value at 
load. Decreased memory use and improved cache performance help as well. 
</P>
<P>
Memory overhead is now reduced to 8 + (number of values + 1) + 1 bytes per tag.
For a tag with one value, this is 11 bytes. That's a lot less than previous 30+.
Noticed the lack of the + ? That's because there is one last important thing
about how MiniINI stores data, the Allocator class.
</P>
<H2>Allocator</H2>
<P>
Even with optimizations shown above, we still have many small buffers in 
different memory locations, each separately allocated and deleted and each with
its bookkeeping bytes. The <I>Allocator</I> class minimizes this overhead.
</P>
<P>
<I>Allocator</I> is a pretty primitive piece of code. Each <I>INIFile</I> has a single
<I>Allocator</I> created at initialization, and asks <I>Allocator</I> to allocate an 
area of memory (usually roughly the size of loaded file). <I>Allocator</I> 
allocates memory in a few large blocks (usually ~16) and any <I>INISections</I> 
created request memory from <I>Allocator</I> instead of allocating it directly. If
there is no space left, a new block is allocated with sufficient size and when 
no memory in a block is used anymore, that block is deleted. 
</P>
<P>
This reduces previously needed 1 new/delete pair per tag to ~16 new/delete pairs 
overall, saving computation time, getting rid of most bookkeeping data overhead 
and greatly improving cache performance since the data is close together.
